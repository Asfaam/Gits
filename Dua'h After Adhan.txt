Waba athu ma-qaa-mam mah muw dal-laziy wa ah-d-ta.


Allahumma Rabba Hathihil Da'awatiTaamma WaSalatil-qaa’ima, Aati Sayyedana Muhammada nil-Waseelata Wal-Fadeelata Wal-Darajatal-'aleyata Al Rafî‘a, Wab‘ath-hu Maqaman Mahmudanilathee Wa‘adtahu, Innaka La Tukhliful-Mee'ad."[13]

Oh, Allah!
Owner of this Perfect Call.
And Owner of this Prayer to be Performed.
Grant Muhammed (SAW) The Right of Intercession and Superiority.
And send him (On the Day of Judgement) to the best and highest place in Paradise which you have Promised Him.
