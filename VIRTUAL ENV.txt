**** CREATING A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT IN VS CODE *******

python -m venv venv

pip install streamlit
pip install mysql-connector-python

Select a python file (preferrably, create main.py. It should only: print("Hello"))
Select a python interpreter (USe the recommended one).
Execute using the Run button.

Use cls to clear everything else.
Type: python -m venv venv
Select yes (to the pop up menu)
Use the bin or delete button to clear the console.

Now the recommended python interpreter carries the virtual environment. You can still manually select it just to be sure.

Select the python file again
Execute again using the Run button.

Use cls again to clear everything else
Type: pip install streamlit (to install streamlit in your virtual environment)
Type: pip install mysql-connector-python (to install mysql python connector in your virtual environment).


Note: Anytime we wish to use the virtual environment, always use the Run button to open the terminal for the virtual environment. 

Use: streamlit run app.py
